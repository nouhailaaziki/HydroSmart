# Hydrosmart

Smart Water. Smarter Living.

## 1. App Concept

Hydrosmart is an intelligent water-saving mobile application that helps users monitor, control, and optimize their water consumption in real time.

Users set a water usage goal (e.g., 20 liters per week), and the app tracks actual usage through smart meter integration. It provides insights, alerts, AI-powered advice, and leak detection to prevent waste.

Hydrosmart empowers users to reduce water waste, lower bills, and protect the environment.
